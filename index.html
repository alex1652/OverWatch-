                <p>Before the military, I was an avarage high school kid who was naive and 
                optimistic of life. With a small family of 2 siblings and I, my immidiate
                family was really close. My hobbies were soccer and hanging out with
                friends and family. As a student, I made sure my grades were good enough
                to be eligible in sports but did not care about doing the best for college.
                With that being said, I knew college was not the best option for me after
                high school. I wanted to do something productive and not just any mediocre 
                job, which resulted in joining the military. </p>

                <h2>Military Life </h2>
                <img class="photo" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRcz5SFziuAwoIv09ZCXzSaKxiU7M73X94pMgOOz_iN45of7yV-&s" alt="">
                <p>I joined the military at the age of 17 right out of high school. Since my 
                family is really close, my mom was reluctant on signing my waver to join. 
                I had to lie to my parents about the job I wanted to do, which was a combat 
                job to get their permission to leave 2 months after high school. My job was 
                combat engineer, with the main objective  of mobility, counter mobility and 
                survivability. I went to basic training in Fort LeanorWood and AIT as well. 
                During this process I was offered an Airborne contract which I did not know 
                what it meant but it paid $150 more a month, so I took it. This course of 
                events changed my duty station to Fort Richardson, Alaska Airborne Unit. 3 
                months later I found my self in Afghanistan doing route clearance trying to 
                find (IED) improvised explosive devices or them finding us to secure the safety
                of the foreign population and U.S armed forces. A year after deployment, I was 
                ready to fulfil my second deployment but I did not have enough time in my contract.
                The retention NCO did not cooperate with some of my demands which led to me getting out.

                <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                <img class=photo src="img/work .jpg" alt="">
                <p> After years of leaving active duty and struggling through life, I have managed to 
                set goals for my future. I realized that I was not completely done with the military so 
                I decided to join the Army Reserve as a Civil Affairs officer. I got a Bachelors degree 
                in Business Management which will give me the opportunity to attend Officer Candidate School and 
                comission as an Army Officer. Civil Affairs deals with public speaking and aiding foreign countries
                during time of war, peace, and natural disasters. Civil Affair Officers maintain peace so that the greater
                military objective can be achieved with the least amount of resistance from foreign goverment and leaders.
                In the civilian world, I want to continue coaching high school athletes and mentor them to become the best
                they can be. For a career job, I have struggled to settle for a job that does not fit me and my idiology. I want
                to be able to work for a company that makes an impact to the community and makes changes to peoples lives. 
                I believe Bitwise can provide that career job I have been looking for and be content going to work.
